# MadeGames

This are the games that I have seen online. Some of the codes have already been written by others, I just modified some of them.

tictactoe: Original Code by @MatthewSteel. Made Use of #MiniMax Algorithm# for the computer to make a move.

2048AI: AI agent make use of expectimax algorithm to run. Evaluation of the state make use of a snake heuristics, main and sub chain length to determine its effectiveness. Greedy search is also used to run but is not really effective. 2048 GUI is taken from Kite, URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4XP2IcI-Bg&t=1s
